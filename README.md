In the Sales Management Project , the primary objective was to create a comprehensive and user-friendly sales management dashboard. This project was initiated based on specific business requests and user stories that outlined the need for a robust tool to track and visualize sales data effectively.

The project consisted of several key phases:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The first step involved data cleaning and transformation, which was performed using SQL Server. This crucial process ensured that the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Data quality is paramount in producing reliable insights.

2. Data Modeling with Power BI:
After the data was cleaned and transformed, the project utilized Power BI to create a data model. Power BI is an ideal tool for this purpose, as it allows for intuitive data visualization, aggregation, and interactive reporting.

3. Sales Management Dashboard:
The final deliverable of the project was a Sales Management Dashboard. This dashboard consists of three main sections:

  a. Overview Dashboard:
  This page serves as a high-level overview, providing a snapshot of critical sales data and KPIs. It enables users to quickly grasp the 
  current sales performance and overall trends.
  
  b. Customer Details:
  One of the secondary pages is dedicated to combining tables and visualizations that focus on individual customers. This provides a more 
  in-depth view of sales data per customer, helping to identify top-performing clients and areas for improvement.
  
  c. Product Details:
  Another secondary page is dedicated to product-related data, showcasing sales performance per product. This section helps in 
  understanding which products are driving sales and where adjustments might be needed.
